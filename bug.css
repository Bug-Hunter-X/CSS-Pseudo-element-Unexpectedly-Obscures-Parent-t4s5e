The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual issue: a pseudo-element (:before) that unexpectedly covers its parent element, even without specified positioning.

```css
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
div::before {
  content: '';
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: lightcoral;
}
```

The lightcoral square completely obscures the lightblue square.  This is unexpected because we haven't set any positioning (static, relative, absolute, fixed) on either the div or its pseudo-element.
