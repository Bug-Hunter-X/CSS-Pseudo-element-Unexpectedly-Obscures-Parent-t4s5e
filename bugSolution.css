The solution is to set the position of the parent element to `relative`. This establishes a containing block for the pseudo-element, preventing it from overflowing.

```css
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  position: relative; /* Solution: Add position: relative */
}
div::before {
  content: '';
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: lightcoral;
  position: absolute; /* Optional: For precise positioning */
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
```

By adding `position: relative;` to the parent `div`, the pseudo-element is correctly positioned within the parent. You can also add `position: absolute` to the `::before` element to have more control over its positioning within its parent.
